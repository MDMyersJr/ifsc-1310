  <h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
  <p>Progressive enhancement is a design philosophy centered around the content. Properly marking up your content with sound HTML gives a better user experience with or without the additional layers you may add. Some users may be unable to access the CSS or JavaScript you've written. In an <a href="https://medium.com/codex/progressive-enhancement-accessible-web-design-on-a-silver-platter-241ab262284b">article</a> by Jason Knight, they mention that HTML is for more than just users sitting at a screen. You want your website to be able to relay the content properly in a wide array of use cases. When designing a website with progressive enhancement in mind, you create a more accessible and bulletproof result.

  <h3>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
  <p>I showed my first draft of the SpaceX Dragon project to my girlfriend, Hannah. She may not be the most tech savvy, but she grew up with the internet. She knows how a website is supposed to look and operate. As you might remember I had a problem getting the SpaceX logo image replacement to work. She still noticed that it was "something she could click" and went to the official SpaceX website with no way to get back besides the back button. I decided to open the page in a new tab to make this less confusing. She also noted that the two blues would look better if I could “blend them” as opposed to the light blue buttons on a darker blue background. So I made the header background a gradient of the two colors. These were the only two suggestions or problems that she could find and I think they made the website much more presentable and usable.

  Putting together everything that I have learned over this semester to create this project was much more difficult than I anticipated. Luckily I have fun tinkering with things and trying to make them work. Throughout the semester the thing that confused me the most was all the different ways to position elements around the page. Inline elements and block elements have different rules and I found myself trying to use justify content center for everything. I had to return to the flexbox froggy exercise just to remember what options I had.

  Even though I had a problem with positioning, I still feel like I enjoyed the CSS portion of the class more than anything else. Presentation is a large part of any website and I've always enjoyed keeping things organized. I really liked tweaking things to get them just the way I wanted them in the final product, and learning all the different methods of presenting content. It's something I can definitely improve on, but everyone has to start somewhere.

  In retrospect, I think the semester would've been better if I had been able to attend class. Engaging in discussion and being able to ask questions to someone other than google seems like it would've helped. I also deprived myself of networking with other people pursuing a career in technology. All in all I think I've built a solid foundation in web development and I can't wait to see how much deeper the rabbit hole goes.
